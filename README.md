## Project Description

Kim's Kitchen is a full MERN stack application that utilizes a front end of React and a backend of MongoDB hosted by Heroku. The application allows users to search for possible dishes that they might possibly make and also permits them to add their own dishes to the site as well. Users might be inclined to spend hours on this application as the possibilities are truly endless with the amount of dishes that are available to view and even create on their own.

## Data Relationships



## Unsolved Problems/Future Features

In the future, I would like to implement full CRUD functionality (mainly adding update, delete, and review routes) and also, I would have liked to spend more time styling the application. This was a challenge for me as I still do not feel super comfortable with React as a whole, but know I am getting better with it each second. This project was a test of trying to connect a frontend with a backend and I am happy with the result.
