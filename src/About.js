            <h2 className="main-body">Kim's Kitchen was founded on the idea between the bond between a mother and her son. Jonathan, the creator of Kim's Kitchen, was inspired by the selfless and endless love his mother provided through the prepared foods she made each and every day for their family. As a result, Jonathan took a part in learning how to make several dishes, however, the inspiration and thought of his mother's homecooked meals never fade as the years go by.</h2>
