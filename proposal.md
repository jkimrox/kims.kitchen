## User Stories

- As a user, I want to search for a specific recipe.
- As a user, I want to be able to create and add new recipes to the catalog.
- As a user, I want to be able to navigate to each route (Home, Show, Search, Create).

## Stretch Goals

- As a user, I want to be able to create my own username and password.
- As a user, I want to be able to catalog my own recipes to my private directory.

## Milestones

I expect to have a working front end (React) for my application done within the first couple of days and a working back end (MongoDB) with CRUD functionality done a day or so after. After that, I can then focus on styling of the application.
